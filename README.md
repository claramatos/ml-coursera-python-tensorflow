# ml-coursera-python-tensorflow

This repository contains the python versions of the Machine Learning Coursera MOOC taught by Andrew Ng.

The starter code is available [here](https://github.com/claramatos/ml-coursera-python-tensorflow).

The solutions are provided in [`numpy`](https://github.com/claramatos/ml-coursera-python-tensorflow/tree/solutions-numpy) and [`tensorflow`](https://github.com/claramatos/ml-coursera-python-tensorflow/tree/solutions-tensorflow).

Each assignment is composed by a jupyter notebook and a python file.
The functions should be implemented on the python file.

Some utility functions used in several assignments can be found on the `utils.py` file.

## Submission

The solutions can be submitted directly on the jupyter notebook.

Alternatively just call the assignment python script from terminal.
